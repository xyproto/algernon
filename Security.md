Hi!


* If you find a security issue, please create an issue or a PR, and I'll look at it as quickly as I can.
* If you are worried that it's a security issue that may be problematic to make public, please e-mail it to `xyproto@archlinux.org`.
* If these instructions should be lacking, please create an issue or PR and I'll look at it.

Happy hacking!
