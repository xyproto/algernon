# VT100

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/xyproto/vt100.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/xyproto/vt100) [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/xyproto/vt100?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/xyproto/vt100) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg?style=flat)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xyproto/vt100/master/LICENSE) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/xyproto/vt100)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/xyproto/vt100)

* Supports colors and attributes.
* Supports platforms with VT100 support and a `/dev/tty` device.
* Can detect the terminal size.
* Can get key-presses, including arrow keys (252, 253, 254, 255).
* Has a Canvas struct, for drawing only the updated lines to the terminal.
* Uses the spec directly, but memoizes the commands sent to the terminal, for speed.
* Could be used for building a better `dialog` or `whiptail` utility.

### Editor

For an editor that uses this module, take a look at [o](https://github.com/xyproto/o).

### The `vt100` Go Module

Requires Go 1.10 or later.

### Features and limitations

* Can detect letters, arrow keys and space. F12 and similar keys are not supported (they are supported by vt220 but not vt100).
* Resizing the terminal when using the Canvas struct may cause artifacts, for a brief moment.
* Holding down a key may trigger key repetition which may speed up the main loop.

### Simple use

Output "hi" in blue:

```go
vt100.Blue.Output("hi")
```

Erase the current line:

```go
vt100.Do("Erase Line")
```

Move the cursor 3 steps up (it's a bit verbose, but it's generated directly from spec, memoized for speed and is easy to wrap in a custom function):

```go
vt100.Set("Cursor Up", map[string]string{"{COUNT}": "3"})
```

The full overview of possible commands are at the top of `vt100.go`.

### Another example

See `cmd/move` for a more advanced example, where a character can be moved around with the arrow keys.

### A small editor using `vt100`

The `o` editor that uses `vt100` can be used for editing ie. Go, Bash or C++ code. Quick installation:

    go get -u github.com/xyproto/o
